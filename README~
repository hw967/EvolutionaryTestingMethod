==================================

*** INTRODUCTION ***

In this package you'll find the evolutinary test case generator for
the ARGoS.

To generate test cases and run experiments with ARGoS, you need to 
install ARGoS3 system-wide and then drop your swarm robotic controller
in the controllers/ directory and loop_functions into 
loop_functions/ directory. 


*** COMPILATION ***

To compile the controller, open up a shell, go to the directory where 
you unpacked the tar.bz2 file and type:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build

To produce debuggable code (slow), type:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..

To produce fast but not debuggable code, type:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

Finally, launch the compilation with the command:

$ make

If you find no error, you're ready to go to the next phase.

*** TROUBLESHOOTING ***

When you launch one of the two 'cmake' commands, you might get an
error like 'package argos3_simulator' not found. This error has two
possible causes:

1. You haven't installed ARGoS3 system-wide. To fix this, install
   ARGoS3 through the packages or with the command 'sudo make install'
   in the ARGoS3 build directory.

2. pkg-config can't find the file argos3_simulator.pc. When you
   install ARGoS3 from a package, this file is located in
   /usr/lib/pkgconfig/. When you install ARGoS3 from the sources, this
   file is located in $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig/. If you
   don't set $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX explicitly before compiling, by
   default it is set to /usr/local.  If the file is present and
   pkg-config can't find it, add the directory where it's located to
   the environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH, e.g.

$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/

When you executing the program and "rror=13, Permission Denied" happened.
Open the Terminal, and direct into the EvolutinaryTestingMethod folder.
Run the following command line:
$ chmod u+x run.sh

*** EXECUTE THE EXPERIMENTS ***
To generate a group of evolved test cases, open the Termanil and direct to
the EvolutionaryTestingMethod and execute:
$ ./run.sh

*** VERSION SUPPORT FOR ARGOS ***
This evolutionary test case generator works fine with version 3.0.0 - beta29
of ARGoS, and have never been checked with any version of ARGoS later than
beta29.
